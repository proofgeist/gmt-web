Structure: Design style is to be clean and vague. I don’t want this site to be an overloaded info dump (like every other boring ss line company).
This site is to uniquely stand out; be evocative – a place where viewers develop a confident, proud feeling by working with GMT.
Imagery: Every picture must create a relatable emotional feeling when viewing our site to prompt them to reach out.
Content: Use all existing language from WP and we can adjust as necessary (or not). As a rule, people do not read (think Instagram). While the copy needs to be functionally accurate, nothing we say will ever compel them to ask for a quote;
Every task-descriptive subpage closes with a Latin woman asking for business via the “click here to get a quote” link to an as yet and undeveloped placeholder page for a form page where the info on the web page will queue into our quotes layout.
 

The new Vercel template needs to be an adaptation of existing WP structure. The structure in WP accurately details the industry specific services we provide.

Use all images from the WP site. We will add as needed. These images were chosen as they have a decidedly blue aura which ties in closely to our corporate blue and vaguely looks like key employees. I also like the design trend of using a letterbox, full frame image on the top of each web page followed by body copy below that.
Avoid images that show any vessel name or any ss line company name as we are not promoting them.
Limit the carousel to 3 images of 5 seconds each starting with the two Latin women with the folded arms.

Please use the GMT 21 logo, not mygmt on the main header and for every sub page (linkable back to homebase). This duplicity in naming convention is intentional as we are still known in the industry as “Global Marine Transportation Inc”.

## Fumigation
Container Fumigation

Why Fumigation is
So Important
A shipping container is fumigated to prevent the entry of quarantined pests into a cargo’s country of destination. When cargo is fumigated, special products are used to exterminate or control the international spread of pests.



The Container Fumigation Process
Container fumigation effectively controls any type of pest through a safe, efficient and dry disinfection process, typically using gas. The most common gases used are methyl bromide and phosphine. Gas is injected through a probe inserted into the container with the doors already closed ensuring it is trapped inside for a specified duration of time. After completion, the container doors are sealed and the shipment is ready for dispatch — confirming the elimination of potentially harmful living organisms.

Without treatment any type of goods and their packaging can be denied entry into a destination country. To verify proper fumigation, destination authorities require written certificates or other proof of treatment.

Fumigation Certificate
Every properly fumigated container shipment from Global Marine Transportation Inc. includes a fumigation certificate.

This pest-control certificate confirms that the shipment has been correctly fumigated according to the destination country’s specific requirements. It also contains details such as the treatment purpose, the fumigants used and the temperature range.

## Cargo Insurance
Safeguard Your Shipment with Cargo Insurance
Cargo insurance mitigates many risks associated with transporting goods by sea, air, road, or rail. It reimburses the insured for financial losses resulting from loss or damage to cargo caused by an insured risk.

Protect the value of your ocean shipments with all-risk cargo insurance.

Explore your policy choices to ensure your coverage matches your exposure risk.



Key Considerations
All Risks Coverage: This comprehensive cargo insurance covers all risks of loss or damage to the cargo, except those explicitly excluded in the policy. It offers the broadest protection available.
Named Perils Coverage: This insurance covers specific risks that may cause loss or damage to cargo as identified in the policy, such as fire, theft, collision, or natural disasters. Although it is generally less expensive than all risks coverage, it provides more limited protection.
Open Cover: An open cover policy provides continuous cargo insurance for a specified period, rather than for a single shipment. It is ideal for businesses that regularly ship goods and require ongoing protection.
Insurance Solutions
Prepare for the unexpected and protect your freight from physical loss, damage, and financial exposure during transit for greater peace of mind.

## Standard Container Sizes
Standard Container Sizes

Container Dimensions
Shipping containers and storage containers can come in a range of sizes, 20ft and 40ft shipping containers are the most common container lengths (externally) and 8ft in width as standard. Commonly the height of a container will be 8ft 6” and a high cube will have an additional foot to be 9ft 6”. Our variety of small new build containers are ideal for small areas and tight corners and a solution if you are restricted of space.

Internal Dimensions
The sides of a container in nearly all cases, is corrugated. The depth of the corrugation is usually 1 inch (25mm), which means that 2 inches (50mm) is lost from the external width dimension (1 inch each side). The back (blank end) is also corrugated and the doors are around 2 inches (50mm) thick meaning that approximately 3 inches (75mm) is lost from the length.

The main reduction from external to internal dimensions is with height. The floor of a standard container has an underside clearance of approximately 6 inches (150mm) and the floor has a thickness of 27mm (1.1 inches). As the roof is corrugated another 1 inch (25mm) is lost resulting in an internal dimension of around 8 inches less than external – 7ft 10 inches (2.39m), though this can vary slightly either way depending on the floor thickness and construction method used.

Though the door height is additionally reduced because of the steel top rail above the door, this is a part of the structural integrity of the container, typically it’s 4 inches (100mm) thus reducing the entrance height to 7ft 6ins (2.28m), though this can vary slightly either way.

Container Weights
There are three relevant weights, the Tare weight, the Gross weight, and the Payload. These are painted onto the outside of the container doors when it is in service or before it has been repainted for another application.

The container Tare weight is the weight of the container without cargo or contents.

The container Gross weight is the weight of the container plus the maximum Payload it can hold i.e. the maximum total weight of the container.

The Payload (or Net weight) is the weight of the cargo or contents that a container can hold.
